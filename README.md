# Hotel Booking Platform - System Analysis

## Current System Architecture

### User Roles and Access Levels

1. **Property Manager (Admin)**
   - Email: manager@hotelplatform.com
   - Can approve/reject property listings
   - Manage unit owners and verify them
   - View all bookings and analytics
   - Create job orders and manage concerns
   - Send contracts to unit owners
   - Full system access

2. **Unit Owner (Merchant)**
   - Email: owner1@example.com, owner2@example.com
   - Add and manage their own properties
   - View bookings for their properties only
   - Accept/reject contracts from property managers
   - Handle guest concerns for their properties
   - View analytics for their properties only

3. **Customer (Guest)**
   - Email: customer@example.com
   - Browse and book available properties
   - Manage their own bookings
   - Leave reviews for properties they've stayed at
   - Report concerns during active stays

### Current Booking Process

1. Customer searches properties by dates/guests
2. System shows available properties (basic filtering by guest capacity)
3. Customer selects property and books immediately
4. Booking is confirmed with payment status "paid"
5. **ISSUE**: No date conflict checking - overlapping bookings possible
6. **ISSUE**: No review reminder system after checkout

### Data Structures

- **Properties**: Stored in localStorage with status (pending_review, approved, rejected)
- **Bookings**: Simple array with checkIn/checkOut dates as strings
- **Users**: Role-based with authentication via email/password
- **Reviews**: Linked to bookings and properties
- **Contracts**: Between property managers and unit owners

### Current Issues Identified

1. **No Date Availability System**: Properties can be double-booked
2. **No Review Reminders**: Users aren't prompted to review after stays
3. **Limited User Registration**: No sign-up system for new users
4. **No Merchant Registration**: Can't register as property owner

## Planned Enhancements

1. ✅ Implement proper date availability checking
2. ✅ Add review reminder system
3. ✅ Create registration system with merchant option
4. ✅ Add additional test users
5. ✅ Improve booking conflict prevention
